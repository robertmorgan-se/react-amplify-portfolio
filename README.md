# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio project! This website showcases my skills, projects, and background as a software engineer. It was built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, and is hosted via **AWS Amplify**.

This is my first project using React or Amplify, and it reflects not only my technical growth but also my eye for clean, responsive design.
