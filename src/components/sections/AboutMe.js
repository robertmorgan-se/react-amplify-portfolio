      “Not knowing never stops me &ndash; it’s where I begin”
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a software engineer with a passion for solving real-world problems and a lifelong commitment to learning. My journey into technology hasn't been linear &ndash; it's been forged through hands-on experience, personal growth, and a deep curiosity about the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      From working as a teenage board operator at a local radio station to serving as a Signals Intelligence Analyst in the U.S. Army, I've worn many hats &ndash; each one shaping the engineer and person I am today. My time in public affairs taught me storytelling through photography and design; my military career taught me leadership, adaptability, and the discipline to excel under pressure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve built ships, designed training programs, worked on farms, and learned everything from wiring electrical systems to editing YouTube content and rebuilding guitars.

      After earning an associate's degree in software and database development (with a Student of the Year award), I completed a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering at Western Governors University.

      My senior capstone project combined my passion for education and AI: a Blazor-based platform that generates personalized learning paths from free online resources using GPT and cloud APIs.

    <p>
      I approach engineering with both analytical precision and creative energy. I enjoy making complex systems understandable, building accessible user interfaces, and connecting knowledge across disciplines &ndash; from psychology and astronomy to history and music.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love learning, teaching, and creating tools that make life better &ndash; and I bring that mindset into every project I touch.

      Outside of tech, I'm a dad, an artist, a musician, a lifelong traveler, and an unapologetic nerd for science, history, and all things curious. I believe knowledge is everything &ndash; and I'm always hungry for more.
